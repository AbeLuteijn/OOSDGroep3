Make sure you select yourself as the owner of the repository. This is done by selecting your own name in the dropdown menu. You can ignore most other options on this page. When you're done click "Create fork" on the bottom of the page:

## 2. Cloning the repository

Now that you have created your own fork of this repository its time to clone it. Go ahead and navigate to your own Github profile and go to your repositories. Here you should find your newly created fork. Open this repository and navigate to the button "Code" on the top right of this page and copy the URL that's listed next to HTTPS. Make sure your clone your own fork and not the main repository.

This should open up a command prompt like interface. Now you can go ahead and make a clone of the repository with the URL you copied earlier. This can be done with the git clone command:

```git
git clone <url>
```

Again, make sure this is the git URL of your own fork and not the main repository.
